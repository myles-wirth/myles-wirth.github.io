          For my final assignment, I designed a library system for the anarcho-syndicalist Odonian people on the moon Anarres in Ursula K. Leguin's <i>The Dispossessed</i>. Presented as a piece of fan-fiction, this integration plays with each of the systems we've studied in this course, as I do my best to refract them through the prism of Odonian philosophy.
          </p>

          <p>
            I eschewed the use of a category system altogether, as linear sorting came with inherently hierarchical implications. I instead imagined that sorting is arbitrarily performed by patrons, who are responsible for recording the shelf position of books upon returning them.
          </p>

          <p>
            My imagined content schema demoted the author and publisher below the physical dimensions of the resource, representing the Odonian aversion to "egoism". Taking inspiration from my analysis of the Anarchist Library, I devised a hybrid subject heading system that included both reader tags and a topic thesaurus as separate attributes. This retained the collectivist spirit of tagging while also giving my anarchist librarians something to do - furthermore, disparities between the two allowed me to suggest the differing priorities between librarians, authors, and readers. <i>Principles of Simultaneity</i>, Shevek's debut publication from the novel, has the author-assigned tags "Physics, Astrophysics, Spacetime, Simultaneity, Sequency, General Field Theory of Time"; however, I imagined a non-physicist librarian trimming these down to just the tidier and mainstream "Physics, Astrophysics, Spacetime, Simultaneity". As it is a key point in the novel that <i>Principles of Simultaneity</i> is only published due to its political significance - an example of Odonian science - this librarian also took the liberty of adding "Odonian Science" to the front of the list.
          </p>

          <p>
            Perhaps most elaborate of all is my hypothetical data format for this system, Contingency Stenograph. Conceived as a sort of "reverse-MARC", I imagined the computer-coordinated society of the Odonians developing a data format to store digital information on paper in the event of computer failures, a likely prospect in the early years of settlement on an inhospitable moon. As the novel also notes the scarcity of paper on Anarres, this format would also need to be extremely information-dense. I sketched out the better part of a 65-glyph alphabet to illustrate what this might look like, and considered how such a format might be regarded by librarians as the problems it was designed to address began to subside.
