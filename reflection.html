<p>I did my most productive learning through the creative assignments; putting systems into practice helped me to build an intuitive understanding of how they worked. It helped me to place the skills we were learning in a real context. I also found these assignments more rewarding and productive to iterate on than my analyses.
<p>My learning is most evident in my <a href=systemsintegration-create.html>final assignment</a>, in which I discovered I was confident enough in my understanding of all systems we had covered that I could play with all of them. Designing a radically non-hierarchical library system for the anarcho-syndicalist Odonians of Ursula K. Leguin's <i>The Dispossessed</i>, I eschewed categorization altogether, devised a hybrid tagging/subject heading system, demoted authors and publishers in my content schema, and proposed a “reverse-MARC” data format designed to encode complex digital information on the minimum amount of paper (using a bespoke 65-glyph alphabet). For all of these, I was able to articulate inherent tensions and trade-offs that my fictional users might encounter.
<p>Participating in in-class activities throughout this course has been an opportunity to exert myself both cognitively and dialogically. Working with classmates has given me insights not only into our topics of discussion, but into the kinds of rhetorical methods and techniques that keep discussion active and productive. This includes arranging ideas into logical propositions; prompting classmates to develop and expound on their ideas; and summarizing themes and patterns in discussions to identify consensus. Recognizing these competencies was a surprise for me, as I’d characterized myself in my start-of-term self-evaluation as not much of a talker.
<p>I found I was able to apply these pedagogical methods in my <a href=content/peer-review.pdf target="_blank">peer review process</a>, particularly when I needed to explain broad and foundational concepts.
<p>Another metacognitive insight this course has given me is that I have an affinity for abstract thinking. During our activity exploring the Functional Requirement of Bibliographic Records (FRBR), I was able to quickly develop a strong intuitive grasp of the model. Explaining it to others, I found myself self-consciously designing heuristics and object lessons in the moment - such as the "Blank Page Heuristic", which was that "if at any point a human sat down in front of a blank page in the production of an Expression, it is, most likely, a new Work."
<p>Overall, this course has significantly helped me to improve my communicative and teaching abilities. While I still feel drawn to public librarianship, recognizing this aptitude has led me to seriously consider academia as another possible path.
<p>In terms of what’s holding me back, rather than any particular pieces of material, time management and organizational skills stand out as areas for improvement. Misreading assignment dates following reading break led to some avoidable late submissions, and I regret not being able to complete my full allotment of peer reviews due to end-of-term time pressures.
