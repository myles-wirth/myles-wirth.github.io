          This assignment was a content schema designed for adding characters to a tactical role-playing video game, roughly modeled on a video game development project of mine. This meant developing a schema for use by both a human game developer and a computer system, which presented interesting challenges. The computer's inability to make inferences or judgements demanded a high degree of specificity; the resulting schema made heavy use of programming variables, which I identified with brackets. This also meant relying on a significant number of controlled vocabularies, i.e. lists. This process demonstrated ways in which, when machine-readability is a factor, the line between a content schema and its data format begins to blur.          </p>
        
          <p>
          The schema consists of a series of attributes that define game characters and their relationships to one another.  As there are many attributes, his schema also includes a category system, dividing these attributes into Basic (static attributes used for identification such as ID and faction), Campaign (attributes that track long-term progression, such as rank and loyalty), Battle (attributes that are relevant only during combat sequences, like combat abilities, resilience, and courage) and Aesthetic (attributes that dictate how the character presents visually).
          </p>

          <p>
          To push the schema further, some layers of interdependency were also added between attributes. For example, the list of available abilities was made dependent on a character's job; the list of available jobs was made dependent upon a character's clan.
          </p>

          <p>
          Peer review was useful for this assignment for judging its readability by those without a game design or programming background - though they were not the intended user, I wanted the arrangement of variables and lists to be logical enough to be human-readable by a non-expert. I applied color coding to make the schema more intuitive, and explained more of my notation choices; I also created some example characters to help illustrate the attributes in use.
          </p>

          <p>
           Despite its complexity, this schema is still represents a heavily simplified and streamlined version of the game system it models. That said, this exercise has helped to clarify certain ordering principles and attribute relationships for me in useful ways. I'll be returning to what I learned from this assignment and continuing to develop my understanding as I continue this project.
